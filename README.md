## Welcome to Yree 🤗

**Yree** is a collective of lightweight, thoughtful tools built around the belief that tech can feel like nature — simple, regenerative, and made with care.

We're not here to disrupt.  
We're here to **heal, rebuild, and reimagine**.

Every project at Yree is part of a bigger picture — tools that work, that stay out of your way, and that give more than they take. Code that respects time, power, and planet.

No bloat. No fluff.

## What Yree stands for 🌿

We build tools that feel like trees:  
- **Rooted** in simplicity  
- **Growing** quietly over time  
- **Giving** more than they consume

Yree is not a startup. It's not a hustle.  
It's a long walk in the woods of the internet.  
And you're invited.

Built with intention.  
Shared with care.  
Forever in beta (because nature never stops iterating).
